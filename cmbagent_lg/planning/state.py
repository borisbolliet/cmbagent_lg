"""Graph state — the mutable bag that flows between nodes.

Flow:

    planner ─► format_plan ─► [route: END if round==num_rounds else continue]
                              │
                              ▼
                          plan_reviewer ─► format_review ─► planner ...

`raw_*` are the generators' free-form prose; `current_*` are the typed
formatter outputs. `history` accumulates one `(plan, review)` pair per
completed review cycle, so each planner pass sees every prior round.
